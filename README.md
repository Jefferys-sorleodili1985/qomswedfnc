Just walked out of Kesari Chapter 2: The Untold Story of Jallianwala Bagh. My brain’s a tangled-up string of Christmas lights right now, and not the festive kind. I’m tired, and there's popcorn crumbs down my shirt, and I think I just witnessed a movie that tried to throttle my emotions and then slap them awake again. Utter madness, I tell you. 

First off, why exactly do they call it Kesari when it’s all drenched in crimson? Kind of misleading when you think about it. But whatever, these filmmakers know their dramatic colors way better than I know how to keep my popcorn in my mouth. The film's supposed to untangle the knots of history but feels more like knotting it up even tighter. Emotional? Oh yes, like a blender set to 'anxiety mode'. 

> There's this one scene, dear lord. It’s like the director decided, You know what this needs? A slow-motion blanket of despair!” I mean, how many times can you watch one man look into the distance before it becomes kind of oddly funny? What do they expect us to find in those endless gazes? The lost socks of history?

The sheer intensity makes you wish for an intermission just to calm your spinning head. But here’s a paradox for you: the more intense it got, the more my tired mind drifted to my grocery list. Do I need eggs? And onions, but that's another story.

There’s this one part where they nab the mood with music – a song that makes your heart feel like it’s pogo-sticking through a field of surreal pain. (Does it make any sense? Nope, but neither does bouncing through fields with your heart.) Also, note to self: download the movie sometime just to see if it’s as emotionally exhausting on a second watch. Although, might be better to just never again, for the sake of mental stability.

Random movie thought: “Remember folks, always try to organize a gathering”... said every clueless committee member ever. But, if in doubt, never ask for direction from the history books. 

```csharp
foreach (var cry in audience)
{
    if (cry.Time < intenseScene.Time) break;
}
```

Don't know why that popped out; I blame the film's head-spinning effect. But seriously, my brain might still be in the theater trying to process – just a burnt toast of thought processes. Don't know if it's good or bad; it just is. I'm off to scrounge for therapy chocolate and rethink my life choices. Watch the movie if you can handle the dizzy emotional rollercoaster… or better yet, buckle up if you're downloading it; it might be safer that way.
